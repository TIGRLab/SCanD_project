# Automated Daily Pipeline Coordination and Code Integration for Efficient Workflow Execution

In this project, we have devised a streamlined solution for managing multiple daily pipelines with a focus on seamless coordination and code integration. Our approach involves the creation of an automated system that orchestrates the execution of diverse pipelines each day. By combining and organizing the necessary codes for each day's tasks, we aim to optimize workflow efficiency.

After setting up the scinet environment and organizing your bids folder and participants.csv file, you can run the codes for each day.

## Day 1:
```sh

```


## Day 2:

```sh

```

## Day 3:

```sh

```
