# Setting your SciNet environment and prepare dataset

## Setting Scinet Environment

### Cloning this Repo

```sh
cd $SCRATCH
git clone https://github.com/TIGRLab/SCanD_project.git
```

### Run the software set-up script

```sh
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
source code/00_setup_data_directories.sh
```

## Organize your data into BIDS

This is the longest - most human intensive - step. But it will make everything else possible! BIDS is really a naming convention for your MRI data that will make it easier for other people in the consortium (as well as the software/ pipeline that you are using) to understand what your data is (e.g. what scan types, how many participants, how many sessions). Converting your data into BIDS may require some renaming and reorganizing. No coding is required, but there are now a lot of different software projects out there to help with the process.

For amazing tools and tutorials for learning how to BIDS convert your data, check out the [BIDS starter kit](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/).


### Deface the BIDS data (if not done during step 1)

A useful tool is [this BIDSonym BIDS app](https://peerherholz.github.io/BIDSonym/).


### Put your bids data into the data/local folder and add labels to participants.tsv file

We want to put your data into:

```
./data/local/bids
```
You can do this by either copying "scp -r", linking `ln -s` or moving the data to this place - it's your choice.
If you are copying data from another computer or server, you should use the SciNet datamover (dm) node, not the login node!

To switch into the dm node: 
```sh
ssh <cc_username>@niagara.scinet.utoronto.ca
ssh nia-dm1
rsync -av <local_server>@<local_server_address>:/<local>/<server>/<path>/<bids> ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project/data/local/
```

To link existing data from another location on SciNet Niagara to this folder:

```sh
ln -s /your/data/on/scinet/bids ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project/data/local/bids
```

After organizing the bids folder, proceed to populate the participant labels, such as 'sub-CMH0047' within the 'ScanD_project/data/local/bids/participants.tsv' file. First row should be "participany id" and then you have all the subject ids in the other rows.

Also, make sure dataset_description.json exists inside your bids folder.

### Edit fmap files

In some cases dcm2niix conversion fails to add "IntendedFor" in the fmap files which causes errors in fmriprep_func step. Therefore, we need to edit fmap file in the bids folder and add "intendedFor"s. In order to edit these files we need to run a python code.

```sh
## First load a python module
module load NiaEnv/2019b python/3.11.5

## Create a directory for virtual environments if it doesn't exist
mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
cd ~/.virtualenvs
virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/.virtualenvs/myenv

## Activate the virtual environment
source ~/.virtualenvs/myenv/bin/activate 

python3 -m pip install bids

cd $SCRATCH/SCanD_project

python3 code/fmap_intended_for.py
```

In case you want to backup your json files before editing them:

```sh
mkdir bidsbackup_json
rsync -zarv  --include "*/" --include="*.json" --exclude="*"  data/local/bids  bidsbackup_json
```

## Final step before running the pipeline

The working directory for pipelines is based on the $BBUFFER environment variable, which assumes access to the buffer space. This setup significantly enhances code execution speed and overall performance.

To request access: If you do not already have access to the buffer folder, it is recommended to reach out to the SCINET group at support@scinet.utoronto.ca to request access.

Here is a sample email you can use:

* Subject: Request for BBUFFER Space for Preprocessing on SciNet Cluster
```
Hello,
I'm [your name] working at [site name] as a [your role] and I would like to request bbuffer space to do some preprocessing on the SciNet cluster. Specifically, I would like to run preprocessing scripts that use third party software that utilize high I/O for both logging and temporary files, and we're running them on large datasets so it would be ideal to run them as efficiently as possible. My account is [your scinet ID].
Let us know if you can get me access, any help would be greatly appreciated!
```
If BBUFFER space is unavailable or you choose not to use it, you need to navigate through each pipeline code and replace all instances of $BBUFFER with $SCRATCH/SCanD_project.


# Quick Start - Workflow Automation

After setting up the scinet environment and organizing your BIDS folder and `participants.csv` file, instead of running each pipeline separately, you can run the codes for each stage simultaneously. For a streamlined approach to running pipelines by stages, please refer to the [Quick start workflow automation.md](Quick_start_workflow_automation.md) document and proceed accordingly. Otherwise, run pipelines separately.

* Note: if you are running xcp-d pipeline (stage 3) for the first time, just make sure to run the codes to download the templateflow files before running the automated codes. You can find these codes below in [xcp-d](#Running-xcp-d) section.


# Running Pipelines and sharing results

## Running mriqc

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull         #in case you need to pull new code

## calculate the length of the array-job given
SUB_SIZE=1
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"


## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/01_mriqc_scinet.sh
```

## Running freesurfer

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull         #in case you need to pull new code

## calculate the length of the array-job given
SUB_SIZE=1
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"


## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/01_freesurfer_long_scinet.sh
```

## Running fmriprep fit (includes freesurfer)

Note -  the script enclosed uses some interesting extra options:
 - it defaults to running all the fmri tasks - the `--task-id` flag can be used to filter from there
 - it is running `synthetic distortion` correction by default - instead of trying to work with the datasets available fieldmaps - because fieldmaps correction can go wrong - but this does require that the phase encoding direction is specified in the json files (for example `"PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-"`).

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

# module load singularity/3.8.0 - singularity already on most nodes
## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull         #in case you need to pull new code

## calculate the length of the array-job given
SUB_SIZE=1
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} code/01_fmriprep_fit_scinet.sh
```

## Running qsiprep

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/01_qsiprep_scinet.sh
```
## Running smriprep
If you want to only run structural data, you will need this pipeline. Otherwise, skip this pipeline.

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/01_smriprep_scinet.sh
```

## Running fmriprep apply 

Note -  the script enclosed uses some interesting extra options:
 - it defaults to running all the fmri tasks - the `--task-id` flag can be used to filter from there
 - it is running `synthetic distortion` correction by default - instead of trying to work with the datasets available fieldmaps - because fieldmaps correction can go wrong - but this does require that the phase encoding direction is specificed in the json files (for example `"PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-"`).

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/02_fmriprep_func_scinet.sh
```


## Running qsirecon step1

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/02_qsirecon_step1_scinet.sh
```
## Running amico noddi
In case your data is multi-shell you need to run amico noddi pipeline, otherwise skip this step.

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/02_amico_noddi.sh
```

To complete the final step for amico noddi, you need a graphical user interface like VNC to connect to a remote desktop. This interface allows you to create the necessary figures and HTML files for QC purposes. To connect to the remote desktop, follow these steps:
1. [Install and connect to VNC using login nodes](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/VNC).
2. Open a terminal on VNC: navigate to Application > System Tools > MATE Terminal.
3. Run the following command:
   
```sh
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

source ./code/03_amico_VNC.sh
```

## Running freesurfer group analysis


```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

# module load singularity/3.8.0 - singularity already on most nodes
## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull         #in case you need to pull new code

## calculate the length of the array-job given
SUB_SIZE=1
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} code/02_freesurfer_group_scinet.sh
```

If you do not plan to run stage 6 (data sharing) and only wish to obtain the FreeSurfer group outputs, follow these steps to run the FreeSurfer group merge code after completing the FreeSurfer group processing:

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

source ./code/freesurfer_group_merge_scinet.sh
```

## Running tractography
For multi-shell data, run the following code. For single-shell data, use the single-shell version of the code.

Multishell:
```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/02_tractography_multi_scinet.sh

```
Singleshell:
```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/02_tractography_single_scinet.sh

```

## Running ciftify-anat

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/02_ciftify_anat_scinet.sh
```


## Running xcp-d

If you're initiating the pipeline for the first time, it's crucial to acquire specific files from templateflow. Keep in mind that login nodes have internet access, while compute nodes operate in isolation. Therefore, make sure to download the required files as compute nodes lack direct internet connectivity. Here are the steps for pre-download:


```sh
#First load a python module
module load NiaEnv/2019b python/3.6.8

# Create a directory for virtual environments if it doesn't exist
mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
cd ~/.virtualenvs
virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/.virtualenvs/myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source ~/.virtualenvs/myenv/bin/activate 

python3 -m pip install -U templateflow

# Run a Python script to import specified templates using the 'templateflow' package
python -c "from templateflow.api import get; get(['fsaverage','fsLR', 'Fischer344','MNI152Lin','MNI152NLin2009aAsym','MNI152NLin2009aSym','MNI152NLin2009bAsym','MNI152NLin2009bSym','MNI152NLin2009cAsym','MNI152NLin2009cSym','MNI152NLin6Asym','MNI152NLin6Sym'])"
```
```sh
#First load a python module
module load NiaEnv/2019b python/3.11.5

# Create a directory for virtual environments if it doesn't exist
mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
cd ~/.virtualenvs
virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/.virtualenvs/myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source ~/.virtualenvs/myenv/bin/activate 

python3 -m pip install -U templateflow

# Run a Python script to import specified templates using the 'templateflow' package
python -c "from templateflow.api import get; get(['fsLR', 'Fischer344','MNI152Lin'])"
```
If you've already set up the pipeline before, bypass the previously mentioned instructions and proceed directly to executing the XCP pipeline:

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## figuring out appropriate array-job size
SUB_SIZE=1 # for func the sub size is moving to 1 participant because there are two runs and 8 tasks per run..
N_SUBJECTS=$(( $( wc -l ./data/local/bids/participants.tsv | cut -f1 -d' ' ) - 1 ))
array_job_length=$(echo "$N_SUBJECTS/${SUB_SIZE}" | bc)
echo "number of array is: ${array_job_length}"

## submit the array job to the queue
sbatch --array=0-${array_job_length} ./code/03_xcp_scinet.sh
```

## Running xcp-noGSR

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

## Check tsv files

At any stage, before proceeding to the next stage and executing the codes for the subsequent phase, it's crucial to navigate to the data/local/logs folder and review the .tsv files for all pipelines from the previous stage. For instance, if you intend to execute stage 3 code, you must examine the .tsv files for both the fmriprep func and qsirecon pipelines. If no participants have encountered failures, you may proceed with running the next stage.

However, if any participant has failed, you need to first amend the data/local/bids/participants.tsv file by including the IDs of the failed participants. After rectifying the errors, rerun the pipeline with the updated participant list.


## Syncing the data to the share directory

This step calls some "group" level bids apps to build summary sheets and html index pages. It also moves a meta data, qc pages and a smaller subset of summary results into the data/share folder.

It takes about 10 minutes to run (depending on how much data you are synching). It could also be submitted.

```sh
## note step one is to make sure you are on one of the login nodes
ssh nia-login07

## go to the repo and pull new changes
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project
git pull

source ./code/05_extract_to_share.sh
```

Copy your folder into the shared spaced:

You need to change the "your_group_name" and put your group name there and then run the code!

```sh
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project

mkdir /scratch/a/arisvoin/arisvoin/mlepage/your_group_name
cp -r data/share  /scratch/a/arisvoin/arisvoin/mlepage/your_group_name/
```

# Appendix - Adding a test dataset from openneuro

## For a test run of the code

For a test run of this available code you can work with a test dataset from open neuro. 

To get an openneuro dataset for testing - we will use datalad

### Loading datalad on SciNet Niagara

```sh
## loading Erin's datalad environment on the SciNet system
module load git-annex/8.20200618 # git annex is needed by datalad
source /project/a/arisvoin/edickie/modules/datalad/0.15.5/build/bin/activate
```

### Downloading OpenNeuro dataset through datalad

```
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project/data/local/
datalad clone https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds000115.git bids
```

### Before running fmriprep, we need to fetch the anatomical T1W scans and download the fmri scans:


```
cd bids
datalad get sub*/anat/*T1w.nii.gz
datalad get sub*/func/*
```

But - with this dataset - there is also the issue that this dataset is old enough that no Phase Encoding Direction was given for the fMRI scans - we really want at least to have this so we can run Synth Distortion Correction. So we are going to guess it..

To guess - we add this line into the middle of the top level json ().

```
"PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-",
```

note: now - thanks to the people at repronim - we can also add the repronim derivatives !

```{r}
cd ${SCRATCH}/SCanD_project/data/local/ls

datalad clone https://github.com/OpenNeuroDerivatives/ds000115-fmriprep.git fmriprep
datalad clone https://github.com/OpenNeuroDerivatives/ds000115-mriqc.git mriqc
```

getting the data files we actually use for downstream ciftify things
